gradleNotesTitle: 'The following needs to be added to a build.gradle to make it compatible with test intelligence:'
gradleNote1: |
  // This adds HARNESS_JAVA_AGENT to the testing command if it's
  // provided through the command line.
  // Local builds will still remain same as it only adds if the
  // parameter is provided.
  tasks.withType(Test) {
    if(System.getProperty("HARNESS_JAVA_AGENT")) {
      jvmArgs += [System.getProperty("HARNESS_JAVA_AGENT")]
    }
  }

  // This makes sure that any test tasks for subprojects don't
  // fail in case the test filter does not match.
  gradle.projectsEvaluated {
          tasks.withType(Test) {
              filter {
                  setFailOnNoMatchingTests(false)
              }
          }
  }
gradleNote2: Test intelligence assumes ./gradlew is present in the root of the project. If not, it falls back to the gradle tool to run the tests. As long as the gradle version has test filtering support, it will be able to run test intelligence.

  tiHelpText: Reduce test cycle time without compromising on quality. Using our ML model, test cycles can be up to 98% faster, by eliminating irrelevant test execution. This will help you to innovate faster, with the same confidence that your changes are tested thoroughly.
  languageAgnosticHelpText: Harness CI can work with any language of your choice - Java, C++, .NET. This gives you the flexibility to use one CI solution for any language and framework, so you don’t need to change anything in your build process when adopting a new technology.
  parameterizationHelpText: Enforce best practices and reuse pipelines between different teams and projects. Creating generic pipelines and templates make it easy for different teams to onboard and spend less time on configuration (and more on development)
  parallelizationHelpText: Build the pipeline anyway you’d like, to make sure it is working for you - run steps in parallel to speed up execution, or in sequential, when there are dependencies. Group steps together for better visibility and management, add conditional execution at any level, and define failure strategy to automate remediation.
  flexibleInfraHelpText: Developers can choose which infrastructure to use to run their build in the most efficient way, according to their technology of choice - from k8s to VMs and macstadium.
  devFriendlyHelpText: Manage your pipelines the same way you manage your code - stored in Git, located with your codebase, written in YAML (using built-in YAML editor, with auto-complete and schema validation), and handle changes using pull requests.
  securityHelpText: Avoid security issues and make sure your code and processes are always within compliance. CI Enterprise comes with full Audit capabilities, flexible and granular RBAC, allowing your team to create custom roles and OPA-backed policies that make sure all your pipelines are safe and secured.
  integratedCICDHelpText: Using one platform for both CI and CD streamline the delivery process, reduce manual steps and friction and help teams to move forward faster without learning and onboarding on multiple products.

      ti: Test Intelligence reduces test time significantly. It runs only the tests needed for the code changes that triggered the build.
      pipelineStudio: Rapidly build your Pipeline and test your code using a visual editor or YAML. You can even sync your Pipeline with your Git provider and work entirely from Git.
      complexPipelines: Create complex Pipelines by using Stages that include Steps for building, pushing, and testing your code.
      containerizedSteps: Containerized Steps follow a Docker-based approach with dependency management in the ephemeral build node/runner container.
      useCaching: Use Caching to ensure faster Step execution by reusing data from fetch operations in previous Steps.
      usePlugins: Use Plugins to perform predefined tasks like building and publishing artifacts, sending events and metrics, and more.
      seamlessIntegration: Harness CI seamlessly integrates with other Harness modules like Continuous Delivery, Cloud Cost Management, and Feature Flags.
