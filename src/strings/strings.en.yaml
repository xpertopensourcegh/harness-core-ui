    Determine the pull policy of the Docker image:
    The default behavior is to download an image if it doesn’t exist in the local cache, unless the “latest” tag is used either explicitly or implicitly.
    “Does not exist” - Only pull the image if it's not found in the local cache.
    “Always” - Always pull the newest version of the image.
    “Mever” - Always use the image from local cache, if available.
