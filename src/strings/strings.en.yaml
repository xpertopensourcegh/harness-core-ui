  pullInfo: |
    Determine the pull policy of the Docker image:

    The default behavior is downloading an image if it doesn’t exist in the local cache, unless the “latest” tag is used either explicitly or implicitly.

    “If not exists” - only pull the image if not found in the local cache.

    “always” - always pull the newest version of the image.

    “never” - always use image from local cache, if available.

    Resources limits allow setting maximum values for the resources the container is allowed to use at runtime.

    Use “Limit Memory” to limit the memory that the container can use. Limits for memory are measured in bytes. You can express memory as a plain integer or as a fixed-point number using one of these suffixes: G, M. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents: Gi, Mi.

    Use “Limit CPU” to limit the number of cores that the container can use. Limits for CPU resources are measured in cpu units. Fractional requests are allowed. The expression 0.1 is equivalent to the expression 100m, which can be read as "one hundred millicpu"
