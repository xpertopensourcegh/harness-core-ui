  pullInfo: |
    Determine the pull policy of the Docker image:
    The default behavior is downloading an image if it doesn’t exist in the local cache, unless the “latest” tag is used either explicitly or implicitly.
    “If not exists” - only pull the image if not found in the local cache.
    “always” - always pull the newest version of the image.
    “never” - always use image from local cache, if available.
